Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chen, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo who is passionate about software development and building scalable, efficient applications. I've worked on projects like RecipeMaster, a Django web app for managing recipes, and have interned at Home Trust and Rogers Communications, where I developed web applications and optimized systems using technologies like Angular, ASP.NET, and AWS.

When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me exploring the latest tech trends or picking up new sports! I'm always on the lookout for collaboration and learning opportunities, so feel free to drop a message if you want to talk tech or team up on a project!
