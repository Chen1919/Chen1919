Hey there! 👋

I'm Chen, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, diving headfirst into the exciting world of software development 🌐. My recent internship at Rogers was a thrilling ride, where I led a team to turbocharge application setup processes, achieving a whopping 95% efficiency boost 💪.

Full-stack development is my playground, especially when it involves creating sleek web applications with React.js and Django 🚀. My GitHub is a colorful showcase of my coding adventures, featuring projects in Python, Java, and JavaScript 🎨.

When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me exploring the latest tech trends or strategizing my next big project 🤔. I'm always on the lookout for collaboration and learning opportunities, so feel free to drop a message if you want to talk tech or team up on a project!
